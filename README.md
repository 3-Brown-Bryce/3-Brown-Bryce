## Hi there 👋

My name is Bryce Brown and I am a student at CCA currently taking the Exploring Computer Science class.

Repository: A project folder with multiple different file including code and other aspects

Cloning: Copying a repository for personal use

Committing and Pushing: when you have a seperate fork you can push code to make it onto the main repository or if you are even just going you can also commit or push.

Branches: Kind of a like a clone, but it is still listed under the repository and can be access by others. It is usually used for a different purpose than the main one, but still uses its code.

Fork: Also like a clone, but this one is intended not to create a different subset for a repository, but this one is usually meant to be committed to change the main branch.
